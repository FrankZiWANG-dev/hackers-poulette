# Hackers-poulette
## Project
This is a webpage with a php contact form for a mockup company.

## Roadmap
The form was created using HTML. Basic styling was added for readability. Basic form processing was enabled using PHP.
After hosting on Heroku was done, mail function was enabled.

Currently, the user can fill in the fields in the form. Upon submitting the form, an html message is displayed and a mail is sent to a Mailtrap mailbox (simulating the user mailbox, as if the user receives a mail).
Error messages are displayed if fields are empty or not correctly filled.

Additional scripting using Javascript and styling using SASS can be implemented later.

## Technologies
The page was created using HTML, SASS and PHP. Additional Javascript might be added later.
